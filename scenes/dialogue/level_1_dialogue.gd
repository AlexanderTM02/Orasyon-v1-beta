			"Hoy! Sino ka?! What do you think you’re doing poking at my front door?!"

	"dialogue3": {
		"name": "Player",
		"text": [
			"Okay, fair point. But they don’t exactly know you’re here, and when weird things start happening, well… people like to blame what they don’t understand."

		"name": "Duwende",
		"text": [
			"Scaring them? Ha! Sila kaya ang nanggugulo dito! Stomping around like they own the place! Do you know how many times they’ve knocked over my pot this week? At ako pa ang masama?"

		"name": "Duwende",
		"text": [
			"Balance, balance. Psh. Why does everyone keep talking about balance? What’s so wrong about me staying here? I have a nice setup! A front yard! And a bunch of clueless humans to prank!"

		"name": "Player",

			"Pfft. Salt? You think I’m scared of a little asin?"

		"name": "Player",
		"text": [
			"Not just salt. You know how humans are. Next thing you know, they’ll start doing weird rituals, calling random albularyos, and before you can blink, some old lady is chanting over your pot at 3 AM."
